# Advent of Code 2020
2020 contest of https://adventofcode.com/

Made in collaboration with [@urbpeti](https://github.com/urbpeti)

Each day got 2 problems, we try to solve them using a language we like, we also want to try out as many languages, as possible.

You can find the programs and the instructions to run the solutions in given folders _(dayXY)_ with some example data, so you can try it out as well.

We would like to achieve, to finish all the task, with different programming languages.
